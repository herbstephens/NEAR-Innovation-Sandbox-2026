# Local First: A Philosophy

## Why "Investment" Is a Dirty Word

---

### The Perversion of Capital

We tell people to "invest" — as if giving money to strangers is virtuous.

- *"Invest in index funds"* — 500 companies you'll never visit
- *"Invest in bonds"* — Governments you can't influence
- *"Invest for retirement"* — Decades of abstraction
- *"Invest in crypto"* — Anonymous teams, speculative tokens

The word "invest" has come to mean: **Give your resources to things you don't understand, managed by people you don't know, for outcomes you can't influence.**

This is not investment. This is abdication.

### What Warren Buffett Actually Meant

> *"Invest in what you know."*

Buffett didn't mean "buy index funds of companies in industries you've read about."

He meant:
- Buy stock in companies whose products you use
- Understand the business model deeply
- Know the management personally if possible
- Be able to evaluate the fundamentals yourself

**The further you get from what you know, the more you're gambling, not investing.**

And yet the entire financial system is built to move your money as far from you as possible:
- Your savings → bank → loans to strangers
- Your retirement → fund manager → stocks of distant companies
- Your taxes → government → projects you never approved

---

### The Local Alternative

What if you could see:
- Which neighbor needs capital for their business?
- Which local initiative needs support?
- Which community project would directly benefit you?

What if there was a system that showed you:
- **People** you could actually meet
- **Businesses** you could actually visit
- **Outcomes** you could actually see

This is what we mean by **allocation** instead of investment.

### Allocation vs. Investment

| Investment | Allocation |
|------------|------------|
| Passive | Active |
| Abstract | Concrete |
| Distant | Local |
| Strangers | People you know |
| Extractive | Participatory |
| Returns only | Returns + relationship |
| Can't influence | Can influence |
| Don't understand | Deeply understand |

**Investment:** Give $500 to a fund that buys fractional shares of 500 companies, hoping the market goes up.

**Allocation:** Give $500 to Maria's bakery expansion, get bread at cost for a year, watch her business grow, have a neighbor who succeeds.

Which one do you actually understand? Which one can you influence? Which one builds community?

---

### The Governance Connection

Here's what nobody talks about: **Every allocation decision has a governance dimension.**

When you "invest" in an index fund:
- Which governments regulate those companies?
- Which officials make policy that affects their value?
- Which laws determine their behavior?

You have no idea. You can't know. There are 500 companies across dozens of jurisdictions with thousands of relevant laws and hundreds of officials.

When you allocate locally:
- You know the officials (or can know them)
- You know the laws (or your agent shows you)
- You can attend the city council meeting
- You can vote for the people who make the rules

**Local allocation is governable. Abstract investment is ungovernable.**

### The Extraction Problem

Abstract investment is designed for extraction:

1. You put money in
2. "Professionals" manage it
3. They take fees
4. They take carried interest
5. They make decisions you can't influence
6. Hopefully some returns come back to you

The system is designed to separate you from your money, extract fees at every layer, and give you back whatever's left.

Local allocation is designed for participation:

1. You put money in
2. You know exactly where it goes
3. You can visit, verify, participate
4. Returns come directly to you
5. You also get a relationship
6. Your community gets stronger

**Abstract investment weakens communities. Local allocation strengthens them.**

---

### The Agent's Role

Your Governance Agent makes local allocation possible by showing you:

**Governance Context**
- Who are the 33 officials governing your area?
- What 12,847 laws affect local businesses?
- What permits does Maria need for her bakery?
- Is the zoning favorable for her expansion?

**Local Opportunities**
- Which neighbors need capital?
- Which businesses are seeking support?
- Which initiatives match your interests?
- What's the track record of each?

**Decision Support**
- "Maria's bakery is fully permitted"
- "Her location has favorable foot traffic"
- "Similar bakeries in the area: 2"
- "Your support would complete her funding round"

Without the agent, you can't see this. The opportunities exist but are invisible. The governance context is hidden. You default to abstract investment because you don't know what else to do.

**The agent makes the local visible.**

### Practical Implementation

#### How Local Allocation Works in TIME Protocol

1. **You earn TIME** — Through birthright and work
2. **You open the agent** — See local opportunities
3. **You choose** — Maria's bakery, local solar project, neighborhood fund
4. **You allocate** — TIME transfers, verified on-chain
5. **You participate** — Visit, engage, build relationship
6. **Returns accrue** — Revenue share, discounts, community benefit

#### The Local Multiplier

When you allocate within your governance jurisdiction:
- Standard allocation: 1:1
- Local allocation: 1.1:1 (10% bonus to recipient)

The system explicitly rewards local over abstract.

#### Verification

How do you know local opportunities are legitimate?

- **Agent verification** — Governance compliance checked
- **Staking** — Opportunity posters stake TIME (forfeit if fraudulent)
- **Reputation** — Work NFTs show track record
- **Physical** — You can visit and verify yourself

### The Movement

This isn't just a product philosophy. It's a movement philosophy.

**Parallel society requires:**
- People opting out of extractive systems
- Capital flowing locally instead of abstractly
- Communities that can self-govern
- Infrastructure that makes this possible

**Local-first allocation is how parallel society actually works.**

Not by declaring independence. By building economic relationships that don't depend on the existing system.

---

### The Questions to Ask

Before allocating anything, ask:

1. **Do I understand this?** — Can I explain what happens to my money?
2. **Can I verify this?** — Can I visit, meet people, see outcomes?
3. **Can I influence this?** — Do I have any say in what happens?
4. **Who governs this?** — Which officials and laws are relevant?
5. **Who benefits?** — Does this strengthen my community?

If the answer to most of these is "no" — you're not investing. You're gambling on abstraction.

If the answer to most is "yes" — you're allocating. You're building something real.

### Conclusion

**Investment has become a dirty word** — it means giving your resources to strangers for abstract returns.

**Allocation is the alternative** — supporting what you know, where you live, with people you can meet.

**Your Governance Agent makes this possible** — by showing you who governs your decisions and what opportunities exist locally.

The future isn't more abstract financial products. It's **local economies, locally governed, with technology that makes the local visible.**
