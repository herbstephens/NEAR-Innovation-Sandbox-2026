# 🌍 Who Governs You?

## A Personal AI Political Agent for Every Human on Earth

## The Problem

Ask anyone on Earth: *"How many people govern you right now?"*

They won't know.

Ask: *"How many laws apply to you right now?"*

They have no idea.

**Democracy is broken because people don't know who's in charge.** You can't participate in a system you can't see. You can't hold accountable people you don't know exist.

---

## The Solution: Two Numbers

Wherever you are standing — right now — this agent shows you:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                            │
│         WHO GOVERNS YOU RIGHT NOW?         │
│                                            │
│         ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐        │

└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**33 people** are making decisions that affect your life.  
**12,847 laws** tell you what you can and cannot do.

Tap either number. See exactly who. See exactly what.

**The agent figures this out automatically based on your physical location.** You don't research anything. You don't look anything up. The agent does all the work.

## The One Job

> **"Tell me who governs me, and keep me informed when it changes."**

This is an AI agent with one job — and it does it end-to-end:

| What The Agent Does | Automatically |
|---------------------|---------------|
| **Discovers** | Finds every official and law in your jurisdiction |
| **Counts** | "33 people, 12,847 laws govern you here" |
| **Drills down** | Mayor, city council, governor, senators, president... |
| **Monitors** | Watches for elections, new laws, resignations |
| **Notifies** | "Your new mayor is..." / "This law now applies to you..." |
| **Suggests** | "Your rep votes against your priorities 73% of the time" |

**You close the tab. The agent keeps working.**

---

## 🎯 Track Fit: "AI That Works For You"

| Requirement | How We Deliver |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Autonomous system** | Agent discovers governance, monitors changes, notifies — without user interaction |
| **Works after tab closes** | Background monitoring for elections, laws, redistricting |
| **Clear boundaries** | Agent CAN: discover, count, notify, suggest. Agent CANNOT: take action without approval |
| **User-owned memory** | All governance data on NEAR blockchain — inspect, export, delete, revoke |
| **Payments in workflow** | Allocation is auditable and constrained |
| **Real job-to-be-done** | "I want to know who governs me without spending hours researching" |
| **One bounded job** | Discover who governs you. Keep it current. That's it. |

**Not a chatbot. Not a demo. An agent that does one job for every human on Earth.**

## Autonomous Agent Behavior

### What Happens While You're Away

```javascript
// Agent runs continuously — you don't need to be there

// Daily: Check for election results
agent.schedule('0 6 * * *', async (user) => {
  const elections = await civicAPI.getElectionResults(user.jurisdiction);
  if (elections.newOfficials.length > 0) {
    await agent.updateGovernanceProfile(user, elections);
    await agent.notify(user, {
      title: 'Election Results',
      body: `${elections.newOfficials.length} new officials elected in your area`
    });
  }
});

// Weekly: Check for new laws
agent.schedule('0 0 * * 0', async (user) => {
  const newLaws = await legalAPI.getNewLaws(user.jurisdiction);
  if (newLaws.length > 0) {
    await agent.updateLawCount(user, newLaws);
    await agent.notify(user, {
      title: 'New Laws',
      body: `${newLaws.length} new laws now apply to you`
    });
  }
});

// On redistricting
agent.on('REDISTRICTING_EVENT', async (user) => {
  const newDistrict = await civicAPI.getNewDistrict(user.location);
  await agent.fullRediscovery(user);
  await agent.notify(user, {
    title: 'District Changed',
    body: 'Your district boundaries changed. Governance profile updated.'
  });
});
```

│  • Take any action on your behalf                           │
│  • Access your precise location (only jurisdiction)         │
│  • Share your data without permission                       │
