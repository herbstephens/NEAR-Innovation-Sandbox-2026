# 🌍 Your Governance Agent

## Know Who Governs You. Allocate Locally. Build Parallel.

**A personal AI agent that shows you exactly who and what governs your life — so you can make informed decisions about where to put your time, money, and energy.**

---

## The Problem

You're about to make a decision:
- Start a business
- Buy a home  
- Support a local initiative
- Choose where to live
- Hire someone

**Do you know which 33 officials will affect that decision? Which of the 12,847 laws apply?**

No. Nobody does.

So people make decisions blind. They "invest" in abstract things they don't understand — stocks of companies they've never visited, bonds of governments they can't influence, funds managed by people who don't know their name.

**Meanwhile, your neighbor needs capital for their bakery. Your local school needs support. Your community has initiatives that would directly improve your life.**

But there's no system to see this. No agent working for YOU.

Until now.

## The Solution: Your Governance Agent

Open the app. The agent shows you:

**This isn't about voting once every 4 years. This is about every decision you make.**

## The Philosophy: Local First

> *"Invest in what you know."* — Warren Buffett

We've perverted this wisdom. We tell people to "invest" in:
- Index funds of 500 companies they'll never visit
- Government bonds of nations they can't influence  
- Crypto tokens with anonymous teams

**"Investment" has become a dirty word.** It means giving your resources to strangers who don't care about you.

**We propose: ALLOCATION.**

Allocate your time, money, and energy to:
- **People you know** — Your neighbor's business, your friend's initiative
- **Places you live** — Local projects that improve YOUR community
- **Things you understand** — Industries you work in, problems you see daily

Your Governance Agent helps you see what's local, what's relevant, and who's actually governing the outcomes.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Discover Your Governance

Based on where you are RIGHT NOW:

```
FEDERAL (8 officials)
├─ President, VP, 2 Senators, 1 Representative...
├─ ~3,000 federal laws apply to you

STATE (8 officials)  
├─ Governor, your State Senator, your Assemblymember...
├─ ~5,500 state laws apply to you

LOCAL (17 officials)
├─ Mayor, City Council, School Board, Sheriff...
├─ ~4,300 local ordinances apply to you

TOTAL: 33 people, 12,847 laws
```

**The agent discovers this automatically. You don't research anything.**

### 2. Get Contextual Advice

Making a decision? The agent shows relevant governance:

| Your Decision | Agent Shows You |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Start a business | Permits needed, officials who approve, relevant regulations |
| Buy property | Zoning laws, upcoming council votes, tax jurisdictions |
| Support local | Businesses near you, community initiatives, neighbors seeking help |
| Relocate | Governance comparison: "Moving would change 28 of your 33 officials" |

### 3. Allocate Locally

The agent connects you to local opportunities:

```
ALLOCATION OPPORTUNITIES (within 10 miles)

LOCAL BUSINESSES
├─ Maria's Bakery — Seeking $5K for new oven (2.3 mi)
├─ TechRepair Co-op — Worker-owned, needs members (1.1 mi)
└─ Urban Farm Collective — Community shares available (4.2 mi)

COMMUNITY INITIATIVES  
├─ Neighborhood Safety Fund — $2K goal, $800 raised
├─ Local School Tech Program — Volunteers needed
└─ Community Solar Project — Accepting participants

PEOPLE YOU MIGHT SUPPORT
├─ Your network: 3 people seeking project support
└─ Neighbors: 7 active projects in your area
```

**Not "investment." Allocation. To things you know, people you can meet, outcomes you can see.**

### 4. Participate in Parallel Governance

As you allocate locally, you earn TIME — the currency of the parallel economy.

- **Work locally** → Earn TIME
- **Support locally** → Earn reputation  
- **Stake TIME** → Gain voting power in parallel governance
- **Trade TIME** → Convert to any currency when needed

**The parallel society isn't abstract. It's your neighborhood, connected.**

## Why NEAR? Why Now?

### The AI Track: "AI That Works For You"

| Requirement | Our Delivery |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Autonomous agent** | Discovers governance, monitors changes, advises on decisions |
| **Works after tab closes** | Background monitoring for elections, laws, local opportunities |
| **User-owned memory** | All data on NEAR — inspect, export, delete anytime |
| **Real job-to-be-done** | "Help me understand who governs my decisions" |

### Multi-Chain Architecture

| Chain | Role |
|-------|------|
| **NEAR** | AI agent, governance discovery, local coordination |
| **Worldchain** | World ID verification — one person, one agent |
| **Ethereum** | TIME token liquidity, DeFi integration |

### Why This Wins

1. **Real utility** — Not another DeFi app. Solves: "I don't know who governs me"
2. **AI-native** — The agent IS the product, not a chatbot wrapper
3. **Local focus** — Counter-narrative to abstract global finance
4. **Parallel society OS** — Infrastructure for an entire movement

## The Parallel Society Operating System

This isn't just an app. It's infrastructure for a movement.

## What We're Building This Week

### Core Deliverables

- [ ] **Governance Discovery Agent** — Location → officials + laws
- [ ] **World ID Integration** — One person, one agent
- [ ] **Decision Context Engine** — "Before you do X, know Y"
- [ ] **Local Opportunity Feed** — Businesses, initiatives, people near you
- [ ] **TIME Token on NEAR** — The parallel economy currency
- [ ] **Allocation Interface** — Support local, not abstract

### Demo Flow

```
1. Verify with World ID (Worldchain)
2. Agent discovers: "33 people, 12,847 laws govern you"
3. User asks: "I want to start a coffee shop"
4. Agent responds: 
   - "Here's who approves permits in your area"
   - "These 4 regulations affect coffee shops"
   - "3 local coffee suppliers are in the network"
   - "Your neighborhood has 2 active food business initiatives"
5. User allocates TIME to local supplier
6. Transaction on NEAR, verified work, parallel economy grows
```

## The Vision

**Today:** People "invest" in things they don't understand, governed by people they don't know.

**Tomorrow:** People allocate to things they know, advised by an agent that shows them exactly who governs the outcome.

**The Great Reset (January 1, 2034):** Every human has a Governance Agent. Every human sees their governance. Every human can participate in the parallel economy.

**This hackathon:** We build the agent.
