# 🌍 Who Governs You?

**A personal AI political agent for every human on Earth.**

Right now, wherever you are standing, there are people making decisions about your life — and laws constraining what you can do. But you don't know who they are. You don't know how many there are. You don't know when they change.

**This agent tells you.**

## Two Numbers

Open the app. The agent figures out where you are and instantly shows you:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                            │
│         WHO GOVERNS YOU RIGHT NOW?         │
│                                            │
│         ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐        │
│         │    33    │   │  12,847  │        │
│         │  PEOPLE  │   │   LAWS   │        │

│                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**33 people** are making decisions that affect your daily life.  
**12,847 laws** tell you what you can and cannot do.

Tap either number to see exactly who and what.

## What The Agent Does

### 1. Discovers Your Governance (Automatically)

Based on your physical location right now, the agent identifies:

- **Local**: Mayor, city council, school board, sheriff...
- **County**: Supervisors, assessor, district attorney...
- **State**: Governor, legislators, attorney general...
- **Federal**: President, senators, representative...
- **Laws**: Every statute, ordinance, and regulation that applies to you

You don't research anything. The agent does it all.

### 2. Notifies You When Things Change

- 🗳️ **Election results** → "Your new mayor is..."
- 📜 **New law passed** → "This now applies to you..."
- 🔄 **Official resigns** → "Your representative changed..."
- 📍 **You move** → "Here's who governs you now..."
- 🗺️ **Redistricting** → "Your district boundaries changed..."

You close the app. The agent keeps watching.

### 3. Suggests Actions

- "Your state senator is up for re-election in 47 days"
- "A new housing ordinance affects your neighborhood"
- "3 of your representatives voted against your stated priorities"

## Why This Matters

**Democracy is broken because people don't know who governs them.**

Ask anyone: *"How many elected officials represent you right now?"*

They won't know. They might guess 5 or 10. The real number is often 30-50+.

Ask: *"How many laws apply to you?"*

They have no idea. It's thousands. Sometimes tens of thousands.

**You can't participate in democracy if you don't know who's in charge.**

This agent makes democracy visible. Two numbers. Updated automatically. For every human on Earth.

## The Vision

**January 1, 2034 — The Great Reset**

Every human claims their political voice. Every human sees who governs them. Every human can finally participate.

One agent per person. 8 billion agents. Global democracy infrastructure.

**Track**: "AI That Works For You"

This is an AI agent that does one job: **tell you who governs you and keep you informed when it changes.**

It works after you close the tab. It's autonomous. It's yours.

*"You can't govern yourself if you don't know who's governing you."*
