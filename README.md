# 🌍 Who Governs You?

**A personal AI political agent for every human on Earth.**

---

## Two Numbers

Right now, based on where you're physically standing:

| | |
|---|---|
| **33 PEOPLE** | govern you |
| **12,847 LAWS** | apply to you |

You don't know who they are. You don't know what the laws say. And when elections change things — no one tells you.

**Your agent does.**

---

## The Problem

Democracy assumes informed citizens. But:

- Most people can't name their city council members
- No one knows how many laws apply to them
- Elections happen, representatives change — and nothing alerts you
- Civic engagement requires research most people won't do

**Result:** 8 billion humans governed by people they can't name, under laws they've never read.

## The Solution: One Agent Per Human

TIME Protocol gives every verified human a **personal AI governance agent** that:

1. **Discovers** who governs you (based on your location)
2. **Counts** the laws that apply to you
3. **Allocates** your political voice across the status quo
4. **Monitors** for changes (elections, new laws, redistricting)
5. **Notifies** you when something changes
6. **Suggests** actions you can take

**You close the tab. The agent keeps working.**

│   CLOSE TAB → Agent keeps monitoring...                     │
│      ↓                                                      │
│   ELECTION HAPPENS → Agent rebalances, notifies you         │
│                                                             │

## Track: "AI That Works For You"

| Requirement | How We Deliver |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Keeps working after tab closes** | Agent monitors elections, laws, redistricting 24/7 |
| **Clear boundaries** | CAN: discover, monitor, notify. CANNOT: vote for you, transfer TIME without approval |
| **User-owned memory** | All data on NEAR blockchain — inspect, export, delete, revoke |
| **Saves time** | No more researching "who represents me" — agent knows |
| **Unlocks new workflow** | Political engagement that was impractical is now automatic |
